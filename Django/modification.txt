will pay add on for this requirements
Let me know whether we can do this or not

I need a login page where user can login into system and upload their data where he can make his data public or private(either read, download or none)

When other user wants to access the private file of the other user he need to seek permission from the user who uploaded the data using a access control 
as mentioned in the research paper and the owner of the file can grant two kind of permissions either read or download

If he give a permission as read the user can read the file but he can't capture or screenshot it

If the user gives the permission as download the user can download the private file of the other user


-access should be two types read and download or both(as read should be screenshot proof and photo proof)
the access type should be choose by the user

-user can revoke access of the permission to the particular user

- there should some major change from the research paper( as mentioned in the beginning)

-poper record showing interface like ganache
